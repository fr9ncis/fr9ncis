~ currently studying computer science (B.Sc.) in Germany ~
programming languages are like tools: the ones I use (or don't) are the ones that
get the job done.

systems programming: C (C99 of course), C++ and Go
scripting/automation: Perl (5 you muppet), sh (posix bash is bloated but works too) and *maybe* Python
web development: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (ES5+, node.js 8+, React etc)

I run FreeBSD and have some GNU+Linux machines, too.
